### Experience

**Brunel University London** *Research Fellow II* __2017 to present__    
	Developed a multiphase model for high-shear and ultrasonic direct-chill casting of aluminium billets in OpenFOAM.    
	Assisted the Wolfson Virtual Engineering Centre in administrating a Tier 3 high performance computing facility (Centos 7).    
	Teaching computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to metallurgy PhD students.    
	**Technical Environment** OpenFOAM, Python, Salome, Linux, Paraview, Git, Matplotlib.    

**University of Greenwich** *Post-doctoral Research Fellow* __2013 to 2017__    
	Developed an acoustic cavitation model for the modelling of the ultrasonic treatment of liquid aluminium in Fortran.    
	Taught the MSc Computational Fluid Dynamics course including preparing and delivering all lectures and tutorials, setting coursework, marking and providing feeback to students.    
	Characterized the acoustic pressures in aluminium and water with an ultrasonic cavitometer sensor. Wrote and published a Python library to handle the conversion.    
	**Technical Environment** Fortran, Linux, Git, Paraview, Python, Matplotlib.    

**CD-adapco** *Engineer* __2011 to 2013__    
	Validated STAR-CCM+ turbulence, casting and radiation modules in STAR-CCM+.    
  Wrote the CFD technical documentation and tutorials in casting, numerical analysis, and general physics (body forces).    
	**Technical Environment** STAR-CCM+, Java.    

**College du Saint Esprit** *Physics Teacher* __2008__    
	Taught A-level physics to classes of around 20 students.

	[https://pypi.org/project/cavitometer-deconvolve](https://pypi.org/project/cavitometer-deconvolve)    
	Python library to convert voltages to acoustic pressures. Validated by experiments in collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).    

* **acousticStreamingFoam**    
	[https://github.com/blebon/acousticStreamingFoam](https://github.com/blebon/acousticStreamingFoam)    
	OpenFOAM application for modelling acoustic streaming under a sonotrode. Validated with Particle Image Velocimetry experiments.    

* **directChillFoam**    
	[https://github.com/blebon/directChillFoam](https://github.com/blebon/directChillFoam)    
	OpenFOAM application for modelling direct chill (DC) casting using a continuum mixture theory. Validated with DC casting experiments at BCAST.
