### Experience

**Brunel University London** *Research Fellow II* __2017 to present__    
	Developed multiphase models for high-shear and ultrasonic direct-chill casting of aluminium billets. Implemented these models in OpenFOAM and validated them against experiments.    
	Assisted in administrating the department's Tier 3 high performance computing facility (Centos 7) including compiling open source software packages (OpenFOAM, VASP) and assisting fellows and doctoral students in submitting jobs.    
	Teaching computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to metallurgy PhD students.    
	**Technical Environment:** OpenFOAM, Python, Salome, Linux, Paraview, Git, Matplotlib.    

**University of Greenwich** *Post-doctoral Research Fellow* __2013 to 2017__    
	Developed an acoustic cavitation model for the modelling of the ultrasonic treatment of liquid aluminium. Implemented the model in Fortran and CUDA (PGI Fortran) and validated it against experiments.    
	Taught the MSc Computational Fluid Dynamics course including preparing and delivering all lectures and tutorials, setting coursework, marking and providing feedback to students.    
	Characterized the acoustic pressures in aluminium and water with an ultrasonic cavitometer sensor. Wrote and published a Python library to handle the conversion.    
	**Technical Environment:** Fortran, Linux, Git, Paraview, Python, Matplotlib.    

**CD-adapco** *Engineer* __2011 to 2013__    
	Validated STAR-CCM+ turbulence, casting and radiation modules in STAR-CCM+ using literature cases.
        Provided support to business partners in turbulence, casting and radiation simulations.    
        Wrote the STAR-CCM+ technical documentation and tutorials in casting, numerical analysis, and general physics (body forces).    
	**Technical Environment:** STAR-CCM+, Java.    

**College du Saint Esprit** *Physics Teacher* __2008__    
	Taught A-level physics to classes of around 20 students.

### Projects

* [**Cavitometer Deconvolve**](https://pypi.org/project/cavitometer-deconvolve)    
	Python library to convert voltages to acoustic pressures. Validated by experiments in collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).    

* [**acousticStreamingFoam**](https://github.com/blebon/acousticStreamingFoam)    
	OpenFOAM application for modelling acoustic streaming under a sonotrode. Validated with Particle Image Velocimetry experiments in water.    

* [**directChillFoam**](https://github.com/blebon/directChillFoam)    
	OpenFOAM application for modelling direct chill (DC) casting using a continuum mixture theory. Coupled DC casting model with external fields (ultrasound and high-shear processing). Validated against casting experiments at BCAST.
